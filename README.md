  Gatsby starter by FullStack Me
</h1>

Power up your blog with the Gatsby starter prepared by FullStack Me!
Apart from blazing-fast [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) frontend generator,
this starter ships with the configuration ready for connecting to a headless CMS [Strapi](https://strapi.io).
With the combination like this, you can easily make your own blog backed by a robust, NodeJS-driven CMS
that communicates all the data into Gatsby generator via GraphQL at a supreme efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this starter.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog
    gatsby new gatsby-ui https://github.com/sainnr/fullstackme-gatsby
    ```

    Your Gatsby site is now ready to go, but it needs some data first.

1.  **Kick-off Strapi backend**

    Use CLI to spin off your Strapi CMS as described in the official docs, or try these steps below:
    
    ```sh
    cd my-blog
    npm install strapi@beta -g
    cd strapi-cms
    strapi develop
    ```
    
    Check out your new CMS admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin`!

1.  **Start your Gatsby UI**

    Generate your pages with Gatsby and fill them out with some data from CMS:

    ```sh
    cd my-blog/gatsby-ui/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Yay! Your website is now running at `http://localhost:8000`.
